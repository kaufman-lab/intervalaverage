Description: This function expands on data.table::foroverlaps to perform fast
	and memory efficient time-weighted averages of values measures over intervals 
	into new arbitrary intervals. This operation is useful in the context any large
	datasets where measures are stored representing a value occuring for the duration
	of an interval, but was written to deal with air pollution data recorded or predicted
	as time-integrated averages over repeating periods. Often this data needs to be
	shifted to non-aligned periods or averaged up to the calendar year (for example). 
	Because this package makes careful use of the highly-optimized data.table package, 
	the intervalaverage function is considerably faster than similar algorithms 
	implemented in SQL.
